  ///- messageDeletedEvent – A message has been deleted by a moderator. The author field contains the moderator's details. This event does not have any display content.
  ///- newSponsorEvent – A new user has sponsored the channel that owns the live chat. The author fields contain the new sponsor's details.

  ///- superChatEvent – A user has purchased a Super Chat.
  ///- superStickerEvent – A user has purchased a Super Sticker.
